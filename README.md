## Welcome to [Frontribe Official Website](https://frontribe.com)

This site is built with [Astro](https://astro.build)

### Project Structure

Inside of the project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
├── public/
│   ├── robots.txt
│   └── favicon.ico
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Hero.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

### Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                 | Action                                       |
